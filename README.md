## üìê Project Structure

The system is divided in 7 microservices, each one located in its own folder within the project:
- Visualization
- Ranking
- Recommendations
- Forecast
- Management
- Database-Ranking
- Database-Visualization

### Visualization

The visualization microservice is a REST API which the only responsabilities are to answer client side requests and delegate their work to the database-visualization microservice via gRPC.

### Database-Visualization

The database-visualization microservice can only be accessed by the visualization and management microservices via gRPC. Its only responsibilities are to handle requests from both of these microservices by retrieving, adding and deleting information from the database.

### Ranking

The ranking microservice is a REST API which the only responsabilities are to answer client side requests and delegate their work to the database-ranking microservice via gRPC.

### Database-Ranking

The database-ranking microservice can only be accessed by the ranking and management microservices via gRPC. Its only responsibilities are to handle requests from both of these microservices by retrieving, adding and deleting information from the database.

### Recommendations

The recommendations microservice is a REST API that answers client side requests and makes use of a ML model to get recommendations for the cheapest airline to flight or the cheapest date to flight.

### Forecast

The forecast microservice is a REST API that answers client side requests and makes use of a ML model to get a forecast of the cheapest airplane ticket.

### Management

The management microservice is able the database-visualization and the database-ranking via gRPC. It is responsible for the addition and deletion of tickets in the databases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building & Deployment 

For the building and deployment of the microservices there is a run.sh file at the base folder of the project. This run.sh script calls a run.sh present in each of the microservices folders, which builds and runs their respective Docker containers <br>
<br>
So, to build the project, the user should use the following command in the base folder of the project: <br>
`./run.sh`<br>
which will start all the containers. To test a specific endpoint, a browser or a tool like Postman should be used.
